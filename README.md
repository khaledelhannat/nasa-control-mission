# NASA Control Mission

## Overview
The NASA Control Mission project is an ambitious web-based mission control system that leverages NASA's Kepler: KOI Table data to identify habitable exoplanets based on essential variables like planetary radius and effective stellar flux. This ReactJS and NodeJS-powered system provides a user-friendly interface to schedule and manage interstellar missions to these identified planets. Here are the key highlights:

**Key Highlights:**
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Utilizes NASA's Kepler: KOI Table to identify exoplanets suitable for human habitation.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive and responsive UI for mission scheduling and management.

- **Personalized Missions**: Users can launch their missions and interact with them on the upcoming missions page.

- **Detailed Mission Information**: Provides essential mission details, including mission number, launch date, destination, and more.

- **History**: Allows users to archive and access previous missions.
